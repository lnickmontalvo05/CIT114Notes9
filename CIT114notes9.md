AWS WELL-ARCHITECTED FRAMEWORK 

WELL ARCHITECTED FRAMEWORK 

-Pillars of the AWS well architected framework (operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization) 

-General Design Principles (stop guessing capacity needs, test systems at production scale, automate to make architectural experimentation easier 

-Allow for evolutionary architectures 

-Drive architectures using data 

*“There can be different levels of priority amongst servers” 

-Pillar 1: Operational Excellence (design principles, definition, best practices and resources) 

-Pillar 3: Reliability (design principles, definition, best practices, resources) 

-Pillar 4: Performance Efficiency (design principles, definition, best practices, resources) 

*“These are necessary parts of a reliable service through framework that stood the test of time” 

AVAILABILITY 

-The period of time when a service is available 

-Formula is (availability = available for use time / total time) 

-Common practice is to identify the level of availability by number of 9s (99.99999999999% or “11 9s”) 

-SLAs (Service Level Agreements 

AWS WELL ARCHITECTED TOOL 

-Available in AWS management console 

-Document the workload answer questions 

(To summarize the topics, I think the best way to describe it would be that seeing how effective the Amazon cloud services are in this instance especially where you can reduce the amount of downtime a server has while reducing costs all around. Adding on, it can be much easier and accessible to do maintenance through servers from wherever and/or interact with said servers.) 

 

(I learned that the framework has been stated to consistently stand the test of time in its effectiveness.)
